### Operation Workflow

1. **Initialization**: Application loads and validates Excel data, reports data quality
2. **Menu Selection**: Choose between manual entry or bulk processing
3. **Input Processing**:
   - **Manual Mode**: Enter specific shipment numbers (comma-separated for batch processing)
   - **Bulk Mode**: Process all valid shipments in the dataset automatically
4. **Data Validation**: Validates each shipment number format and existence
5. **Document Generation**: Creates multi-page documents with formatting preservation
6. **Output Confirmation**: Reports success/failure for each shipment processed
7. **Session Management**: Option to return to main menu or exit

### Input Specifications

- **Shipment Numbers**: Exactly 10 digits, no letters/special characters
- **Batch Input**: Comma-separated values (e.g., `"1234567890, 9876543210"`)
- **Data Matching**: Handles float values in Excel (e.g., `9010157586.0` → `9010157586`)

## Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **File Discovery**: Locates Excel files using glob pattern matching
2. **Data Loading**: Pandas reads Excel with automatic type inference
3. **Data Cleaning**: Removes rows with empty Shipment Nbr
4. **Validation**: Filters out invalid DO # formats using regex validation
5. **Memory Storage**: Keeps validated data in memory for fast lookups

### Document Generation Process

For each shipment:

1. **Data Grouping**: Groups records by DO # using pandas groupby
2. **Data Aggregation**:
   - Combines unique PO numbers (newline-separated)
   - Sums Original Qty values per DO #
   - Preserves shipment-level metadata
3. **Template Processing**: Creates fresh document copy for each page
4. **Placeholder Replacement**: Advanced text replacement preserving formatting
5. **Multi-page Assembly**: Adds page breaks and copies formatted content
6. **File Output**: Saves with standardized naming convention

### Advanced Formatting Preservation

The application uses sophisticated formatting preservation techniques:

- **Run-level formatting**: Preserves font names, sizes, colors, and styles
- **Paragraph formatting**: Maintains alignment, spacing, and line spacing
- **Mixed formatting handling**: Preserves different formatting within single paragraphs
- **Cross-run placeholder replacement**: Handles placeholders spanning multiple formatted runs
- **Table formatting**: Preserves table styles and cell formatting
- **Header/footer preservation**: Maintains formatting in document headers and footers

### Data Transformation Details

#### Shipment-Level Data

(consistent across all pages):

- `Shipment Nbr`: Converted to clean integer (removes `.0` decimals)
- `Label Type`, `Order Type`, `Pmt Term`: Used as-is from first record
- `Start Ship`: Formatted as MM/DD/YYYY using pandas datetime parsing
- `VAS`: Converted to "VAS" (if Y) or "NOT VAS" (if N or empty)

#### DO-Level Data

(specific per page):

- `DO #`: Formatted with leading zeros to 10 digits total (e.g., `"66455734"` → `"0066455734"`)
- `Ship To`: From first record of DO # group
- `PO`: All unique POs for DO #, joined with newlines
- `Original Qty`: Sum of quantities with "Units" suffix (e.g., `"7782 Units"`)

## Error Handling & Validation

### File Validation

- **Missing Excel file**: Clear error with search pattern details
- **Missing template**: Specific path validation with helpful messages
- **Permission errors**: Graceful handling of read/write access issues

### Data Validation

- **Column verification**: Reports specific missing required columns
- **Shipment number format**: Regex validation for exact 10-digit requirement
- **DO # format**: Minimum 8-digit validation with detailed error messages
- **Data existence**: Validates shipment exists in filtered dataset

### Processing Resilience

- **Continue on error**: Processes remaining shipments after individual failures
- **Detailed logging**: Reports processing status for each DO # and shipment
- **Session summaries**: Provides counts of successful/failed operations

## Performance Optimizations

- **Single file read**: Excel loaded once at startup, not per shipment
- **Vectorized operations**: Pandas operations for efficient filtering and grouping
- **Memory-based processing**: All operations work with in-memory datasets
- **Batch processing**: Multiple shipments processed in single session
- **Template reuse**: Efficient document copying with formatting preservation

## Output Specifications

**File Location**: `Placards/` folder (auto-created)
**Naming Convention**: `Placard_[ShipmentNumber].docx`
**Content Structure**: Multi-page document with one page per DO #
**Formatting**: Complete template formatting preserved across all pages

**Data Formatting**:

- DO # with leading zeros (10 digits)
- Quantities with "Units" suffix
- Clean shipment numbers (no decimals)
- Formatted dates (MM/DD/YYYY)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Setup Issues

#### No Excel file found

- Verify file is in `Data/` folder
- Check filename starts with `"WM-SPN-CUS105 Open Order Report"`
- Ensure file extension is `.xlsx` or `.xls`

#### Template file not found

- Confirm `placard_template.docx` exists in `Template/` folder
- Check exact spelling and capitalization
- Verify file is not corrupted or password-protected

### Data Issues

#### Missing required columns

- Excel must contain all 10 required columns (case-sensitive)
- Check for extra spaces or different casing in column names
- Verify columns are not hidden in Excel

#### Invalid shipment number format

- Shipment numbers must be exactly 10 digits
- Remove any letters, spaces, or special characters
- Check for leading/trailing spaces in input

#### No data found for shipment

- Verify shipment number exists in Excel data
- Check if shipment was filtered out during validation
- Ensure DO # values meet minimum 8-digit requirement

### Processing Issues

#### Error saving document

- Check write permissions to `Placards/` folder
- Ensure target file is not open in another application
- Verify sufficient disk space available

#### Error copying formatted content

- Template file may be corrupted or incompatible
- Try recreating template with simpler formatting
- Check for unsupported Word features in template
